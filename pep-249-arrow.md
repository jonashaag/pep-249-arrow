# PEP: XXXX
## Title: Python Database API Specification v2.1 - Arrow Extension
## Author: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
## Status: Draft
## Type: Standards Track
## Content-Type: text/x-rst
## Created: DD-MM-YYYY

## Abstract

This PEP proposes an extension to the Python Database API Specification v2.0 (PEP 249) to include methods that return query results as `pyarrow.Table` objects. This extension aims to provide an efficient way to handle large datasets and improve interoperability with Apache Arrow.

## Specification

### Additions to Cursor Objects

The following methods and attributes are added to the `Cursor` objects:

#### `arrow_fetchall()`

Fetch all (remaining) rows of a query result, returning them as a single `pyarrow.Table`. Implementations do not need to take into account the cursor's `arraysize` attribute. Error handling is equivalent to the `fetchall()` method.

#### `arrow_fetchmany([size])`

Fetch the next set of rows of a query result, returning a `pyarrow.Table`. An empty `pyarrow.Table` is returned when no more rows are available. The number of rows to fetch per call is specified by the `size` parameter. If it is not given, the number of rows to be fetched may be chosen freely by the implementation. The method should try to fetch as many rows as indicated by the `size` parameter. If this is not possible due to the specified number of rows not being available, fewer rows may be returned. Error handling is equivalent to the `fetchmany()` method.

#### `arrow_apilevel`

An attribute analogous to `apilevel` that always has the value "1.0".

## Things Not Covered by This PEP

### Data Types of the Returned `pyarrow.Table`

For efficiency reasons, the Arrow data types returned from the `arrow_fetchall()` and `arrow_fetchmany()` methods are implementation defined. Note that they may depend on the actual data that is fetched from the database; for example, an implementation may decide to use a smaller integers type in the resulting `pyarrow.Table` than is used to represent the data in the database.
